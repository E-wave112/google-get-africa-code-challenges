* All my code tasks on Data Structures and Algorithmic problems in the 2021 Get-Ahead Africa program organized by [Google](https://about.google/) and coding challenges on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

* [Histogram and Areas](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/blob/main/histogram.py) This code task helps to find area of the maximum rectangle under the curve of the histogram and returns the pair of array indices that represent the rectangle.


*  A more efficient and scalable way of solving the [balanced parenthesis](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/blob/main/get-ahead-2/balanced.py) Challenge


* [Hash Tables](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/blob/main/hash_table.py) A [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) implementation in python from scratch.

* [Car_plate_vocabulary](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/blob/main/car_plate_vocabulary.py) In this code task, we are to find the shortest word from a vocabulary that includes all the letters from a given licence plate.

* [Longest_path](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/blob/main/longest_path.py) in this code task,
 we are to write a function that computes the length of the longest path of consecutive integers in a tree. 
 
 * [This](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/tree/main/get-ahead-2) Folder contains all the coding challenges for the second cohort of google get ahead
 
 * [Balanced Parenthesis](https://github.com/E-wave112/google-get-africa-code-challenges/blob/main/balanced_parenthesis.py) this code task finds the size of the longest contiguous substring of balanced parentheses from a string of parentheses. Parentheses are considered balanced when there is a valid closing parenthesis for an opening one.
